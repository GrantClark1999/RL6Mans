## Gameplay

### Starting a Queue

To start queueing for a 6-mans, type `rl!queue`. You will become the host of that queue, and people of your rank or higher will be able to join your queue.

### Registration

When the queue starts, a message will be sent out for other users to register in your game.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embed / Message:
  - The host of the queue
  - The role(s) that queue allows
  - The current registered players, along with their respective statuses and rank/roles
  - Reaction -> Action mapping

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reactions:
  - ✅ -> Join/Leave
  - 🟢 -> Ready/Not Ready

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next State:
  - [Mode Select](#mode-select) : When 6 people have joined the queue and have all readied-up

#### Captains Mode

In this mode, two people from the queue will be chosen at random to be the team captains. One of the captains will be chosen at random to go first. That captain will choose 1 player to add to their team. The second captain will then choose 2 players to add to their team. The last player will be assigned to the first captain's team.
